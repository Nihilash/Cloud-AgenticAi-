# 🔊 Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent (Agentic AI Project)

## 🚀 Problem Statement

**(Problem No. 32 – Electronics and Communication Engineering - Agentic AI Project)**  
In audio hardware design, engineers often face challenges related to **noise, distortion, and filter design** when working with circuits such as **preamplifiers, op-amps, and amplifiers**. Manually troubleshooting these issues is time-consuming and requires deep domain knowledge.

> **The challenge:**  
> Design an intelligent agent that can assist engineers in debugging and optimizing audio circuits by answering queries like:
> - “Why is my audio amplifier producing noise?”
> - “How do I reduce distortion in my op-amp?”
> - “What filter should I use for 50Hz hum rejection?”

## 🧠 Proposed Solution

We developed an **Agentic AI-powered Audio Signal Processing Assistant** using **IBM watsonx Prompt Lab** and **Granite AI foundation models**. This assistant can:

- Understand technical queries related to analog audio circuits.
- Provide grounded, practical suggestions for:
  - **Noise reduction**
  - **Filter design**
  - **Signal integrity**
  - **Grounding tips**
  - **Amplifier debugging**

This system does **not rely on traditional machine learning**. Instead, it uses **prompt engineering** and **Granite AI** models to generate intelligent, expert-level responses.
