🔊 Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent (Agentic AI Project)
🚀 Problem Statement
(Problem No. 32 – Electronics and Communication Engineering - Agentic AI Project)
In audio hardware design, engineers often face challenges related to noise, distortion, and filter design when working with circuits such as preamplifiers, op-amps, and amplifiers. Manually troubleshooting these issues is time-consuming and requires deep domain knowledge.

The challenge:
Design an intelligent agent that can assist engineers in debugging and optimizing audio circuits, by answering queries like:

“Why is my audio amplifier producing noise?”

“How do I reduce distortion in my op-amp?”

“What filter should I use for 50Hz hum rejection?”

🧠 Proposed Solution
We developed an Agentic AI-powered Audio Signal Processing Assistant using IBM watsonx Prompt Lab and Granite AI foundation models. This assistant can:

Understand technical queries related to analog audio circuits.

Provide grounded, practical suggestions for:

Noise reduction

Filter design

Signal integrity

Grounding tips

Amplifier debugging

The system was built without traditional machine learning pipelines — it leverages prompt engineering and Granite AI for reasoning, design assistance, and explanation.
